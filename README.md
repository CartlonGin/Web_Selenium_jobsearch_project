# WebCrawler/Selenium_jobsearch_project

### Object: Automatically scrape all the job titles and links in different categories, and organize into an excel file.
##### Tech: Python/Selenium/Openpyxl
##### Web: https://www.adecco.com.tw/advancedsearch.aspx?search=1
##### Note: There are many categories in the job list, so the point is to be able to scrape jobs by each different category.
   * First, scrape all the pages in the same category.
   * Second, scrape the next category.
   * Third, sequentially write all the results in an excel file.
